# Documentation - Multi-residential contact list

## Rough notes

### The ask

In order to reach people in apartment buildings, we'll need someone who is able to give us physical access so we can do litdrops.

The superintendent is supposed to arrange this, but they can be very difficult to work with. So we should try to contact residents as well.

This spreadsheet has all the multi-unit addresses in Kitchener Ward 10. I'd like you to try to find:

1) Superintendent / property management contact info for each property

2) Name and personal phone numbers for each resident, if possible. Gather from public sources like the white pages. 

2a) If personal phone numbers are in the National Do Not Call Registry, remove them from the dataset

### Data sources
