# Questions

* Difference between UNIT, VERTICAL_UNIT, HORIZONTAL_UNIT

* Impact of PENDING status

# Observations / conclusions

* In Ward 10, only 21 buildings with 100+ units. Would be reasonable to search these manually.

* Significant number of Ward 10 buildings have only one unit, so this may not be exclusively multi-residential buildings. Is there a way to identify buildings where we don't need special permission to access?

# Potential future work

* Plot concentrations of buildings on a map
