# Options for finding numbers and names from addresses

## Trestle
API Documentation URL: https://trestle-api.redoc.ly/#operation/getCNAM

**Pros:**
* Contains an API with a "Reverse Address" search which provides current residents 
and phone numbers among others
* Has a free trial which could possibly be used to get all info at once

**Cons**
* Costs $0.07 per query (per address) outside of free trial


## 411Canada

**Pros**
* Completely free
* Well respected institution, likely more accurate numbers

**Cons**
* Would need to be web scraped (Slow and possibly unreliable)
